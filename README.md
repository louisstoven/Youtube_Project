# Power BI Dashboard Project

## Overview
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard that I developed as part of my learning journey in data visualization and DAX techniques. Initially inspired by a YouTube tutorial, I aimed to enhance my understanding of Power BI and DAX functions. 
After following the tutorial, I applied the new skills I learned to create my own Power BI dashboard.

## Project Goals
The primary goals of this project are to:

Deepen my understanding of Power BI and its capabilities.
Enhance my skills in DAX for data analysis and visualization.
Create an insightful and interactive dashboard that presents data effectively.
Develop a unique implementation inspired by an existing tutorial while adding my personal touch.

## Learning Resources
YouTube Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLxW9ZSuuVI - This video provided a foundational understanding of Power BI and DAX functions that I built upon.
